<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm Sandip Varkey George, and you've reached my webpage. I am presently a research fellow at the University College London in the United Kingdom
  working in the Department of Computer Science as part of the CHIMERA hub. In June 2023, I'll be moving to the University of Aberdeen as a lecturer of Physics.
  Prior to joining UCL, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands. My research interests mainly centers around dynamical systems
  and nonlinear time series analysis, though I am interested in applying this approach in a variety of different data-types.
  In particular, I have tried to understand the dynamics of pulsating and eclipsing variable stars, psychiatric disorders and critical care data from the framework of
  time series analyis.</p>
