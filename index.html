<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm Sandip Varkey George, and you've reached my webpage. I am a lecturer of Physics at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.
  Prior to joining the University of Aberdeen, I was a postdoctoral researcher working in the Department of Computer Science as part of the CHIMERA hub at the University College London
  and prior to that, at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands. My research interests mainly centers around dynamical systems
  and nonlinear time series analysis, though I am interested in applying this approach in a variety of different data-types.
  In particular, I have tried to understand the dynamics of pulsating and eclipsing variable stars, psychiatric disorders and critical care data from the framework of
  time series analyis.</p>
